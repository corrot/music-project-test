   stop looking at the screen like a fuckhead and hit ENTER, dude!

#### Life Cycle:

1. right-click inside project folder > git bash here;
2. git pull;
3. open the project file and do whatever the fuck you think you wanna do;
4. git add . (this command is used to stage current changes for commiting);
5. git commit -m "your comment" (this commits current changes to local branch)
   please, make sure to structure your comment like this: "add vocal track" or "delete garbage tracks" or "fucked up whole shit"
   see the pattern? use it!
6. git push (this pushes current commit to remote branch so that others can view and edit your shit);
7. if there are merge conflicts stop panicking and fucking call me :/

#### .gitignore

you should've already noticed there's a freaky little file called .gitignore
that mofo contains information about which folders to be excluded from the project
in other words, fucking put the fucking name of the fucking folder here if you don't fucking want to fucking waste shit tones of fucking space, bitch!!
in other words, if you have a large file that you want to send manually, you should put it in the folder called "res" (which is already included in .gitignore :P)
